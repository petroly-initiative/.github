Yes. We pay for many services to keep our project up, and easy accessible to every student. That is our goal, free useful digital servcies. We welcome your kind sponsor.

## Why wasn't this open source project ?

From the beginning we did not plan that our work to be published in any kind. That decision was made for good reasons:

- Large compatibility issues.
- Codes start with serious security points in its alpha stage.
- Plans or future features wasnâ€™t clear.

## Open Source ðŸ˜„ðŸ”¥

In Petroly Initiative we believe in the fascinating open source communities. And we had a lot of discussions wether we are ready to open our doors for developers. And we decided **YES !**

## Can I help ?
