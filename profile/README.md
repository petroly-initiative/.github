# Petroly Initiaitve

## Who are we?

We are a good people from KFUPM, doing our best to provide students with greatest digital tools.
Our projects start as small seed that turned into amazing tree every student benifets from.

## Our tools

- Python
- Django
- Heroku
- PosgreSQL
- GraphQL
- Reach.js
- Vercel
- Next.js

## Why wasn't this open source project ?

From the begining we did not plan that our work to be published in any kind. That deicision was made for good reasons:

- Large compatibility issues.
- Codes start with serious securtity points in its alpha stage.
- Plans or future features wans clear.

## Open Source ðŸ˜„ðŸ”¥

In Petroly Initiatve we belive in the fascinating open source communities. And we had a lot of discusions wether we are ready to open our doors for developers. And we decied **YES !**
